When I was a kid I used to play MUDs a lot.  This is not a MUD.  This is a just a silly little project to keep my busy.

Seems I forgot to push my changes from past couple nights.  I think I had fixed the location_desc_box not updating, and I believe the player was able to move from room to rooms.

Currently I have the inventory system, items, movement, and base classes working.  I feel combat could be handled better.  Right now it's all on the weapon the player is using.
